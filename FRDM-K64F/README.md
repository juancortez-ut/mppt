These are some important links that I have found to start developing on the FRDM-K64F board. I recommend using the ARM mbed Online Development Platform, importing the mbed library, and using the SEEED CAN-BUS Shield library written by Sophie Dexter.

ARMmbed - The official mbed C/C++ SDK provides the software platform and libraries to build applications.

This library for Seeed Studio's CAN-BUS Shield has a similar API to mbed's LPC1768 CAN library making it easy to add CAN functionality to mbed systems that support Arduino type 'Shields. This Beta release of my CAN-BUS Library is largely working but lacks interrupt 'attach' functions.
