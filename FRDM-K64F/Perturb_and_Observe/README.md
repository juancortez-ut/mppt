# Perturb And Observe Algorithm

This directory contains the source files and test files for the Perturb and Observe Algorithm. The algorithm was written through the use of the P&O_Algorithm_Flowchart file. 

The main.cpp file includes the code that is to be integrated into the FRDM-K64F microcontroller.

Once the code has been uploaded to the board, you can use a Terminal Emulator to view the contents being printed.

Terminal Emulator Command on Mac:

    $screen `ls | grep tty.usbmodem`

The 'test' directory includes a test file that replicates hardware inputs.
