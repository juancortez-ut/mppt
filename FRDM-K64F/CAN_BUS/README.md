CAN-BUS Shield SEEED Studios

This library for Seeed Studio's CAN-BUS Shield has a similar API to mbed's LPC1768 CAN library making it easy to add CAN functionality to mbed systems that support Arduino type 'Shields. This Beta release of my CAN-BUS Library is largely working but lacks interrupt 'attach' functions.
